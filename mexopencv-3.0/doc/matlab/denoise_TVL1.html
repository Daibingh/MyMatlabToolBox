<pre><code>result = <a href="denoise_TVL1.html">cv.denoise_TVL1</a>(observations)
result = <a href="denoise_TVL1.html">cv.denoise_TVL1</a>(observations, 'OptionName',optionValue, ...)
</code></pre>

<h2> Input</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>observations</strong> This cell array should contain one or more noised
versions of the image that is to be restored. All images should have
the same size and <code>uint8</code> type (grayscale).</li>
</ul>

<h2> Output</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>result</strong> the denoised 8-bit image.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Options</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lambda</strong> Corresponds to <code>lambda</code> in the formulas below. As it is
enlarged, the smooth (blurred) images are treated more favorably than
detailed (but maybe more noised) ones. Roughly speaking, as it becomes
smaller, the result will be more blur but more sever outliers will be
removed. default 1.0</li>
<li><strong>NIters</strong> Number of iterations that the algorithm will run. Of course, as
more iterations as better, but it is hard to quantitatively refine
this statement, so just use the default and increase it if the results
are poor. default 30</li>
</ul>

<p>Primal-dual algorithm is an algorithm for solving special types of
variational problems (that is, finding a function to minimize some
functional). As the image denoising, in particular, may be seen as the
variational problem, primal-dual algorithm then can be used to perform
denoising and this is exactly what is implemented.</p>

<p>It should be noted, that this implementation was taken from the July 2013
blog entry [MA13], which also contained (slightly more general) ready-to-use
source code on Python. Subsequently, that code was rewritten on C++ with the
usage of OpenCV by <em>Vadim Pisarevsky</em> at the end of July 2013 and finally it
was slightly adapted by later authors.</p>

<p>Although the thorough discussion and justification of the algorithm involved
may be found in [ChambolleEtAl], it might make sense to skim over it here,
following [MA13]. To begin with, we consider the 1-byte gray-level images as
the functions from the rectangular domain of pixels (it may be seen as set
<code>{(x,y) in NxN | 1&lt;=x&lt;=n, 1&lt;=y&lt;=m}</code> for some <code>m,n in N</code> into <code>{0,1,...,255}</code>.
We shall denote the noised images as <code>f_i</code> and with this view, given some
image <code>x</code> of the same size, we may measure how bad it is by the formula:</p>

<pre><code>|| nabla_x || + lambda * sum_i || x - f_i ||
</code></pre>

<p><code>|| . ||</code> here denotes L2-norm and as you see, the first addend states that
we want our image to be smooth (ideally, having zero gradient, thus being
constant) and the second states that we want our result to be close to the
observations we've got. If we treat <code>x</code> as a function, this is exactly the
functional what we seek to minimize and here the Primal-Dual algorithm comes
into play.</p>
